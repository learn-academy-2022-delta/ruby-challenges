# Arithmetic Challenges
# Remember that floats are numbers with a decimal point whereas integers have no fractional part so in Ruby, 1 and 1.0 are different types of things with slightly different behaviors.

# 1. Add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers and floats.
    p 2 + 3
    p 10 - 7
    p 5 * 10
    p 8 / 4
    p 8.0 / 4.0
# 2. Find the remainder of dividing two numbers using the modulo operator (%).
    p 30 % 2
    p 34 % 3

# 3. Divide a number by 0.
    # p 20 / 0 

# 4. Divide 0 by 0.
    #  p 0 / 0

# Variables Challenges

# Set a variable called my_favorite_number equal to your favorite number
    p my_favorite_number = 5

# Calculate your favorite number divided by 2
    p my_favorite_number / 2


# Set another variable called someones_favorite equal to 13
    p someones_favorite = 13


# Change the value of someones_favorite to 7
    p someones_favorite = 7
    p someones_favorite

# Subtract my_favorite_number from someones_favorite
    p my_favorite_number - someones_favorite


# Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value
    p my_favorite_number = my_favorite_number * 26
    p my_favorite_number

# Strings Challenges

# Create a variable and return it in a sentence string interpolation
    p my_name = 'Bill'
    p "Hello #{my_name}"

# Create a variable that contains a string and test some of the Ruby 

# string methods :
# .upcase
    p my_name.upcase
# .reverse
    p my_name.reverse
# .include?
    p my_name.include?('B')
# .capitalize
    p my_name.capitalize

# Arrays Challenges

# Create an array that contains the name of at least five TV shows
    p tv_array = ['Spongebob', 'Dexter', 'Quantico', 'Ozark', 'Blindspot']

# Find the length of the array
    p tv_array.length

# Return the first item in the array
    p tv_array.first

# Return the fourth item in the array
    p tv_array[3]

# Permanently reverse the order of the array
    p tv_array.reverse!

# Create a new empty array for your top favorite TV shows
    p top_favs = []

# From the full TV show array, add your top two favorite shows to the empty array
    p top_favs = ['Quantico', 'Dexter']
    p top_favs
