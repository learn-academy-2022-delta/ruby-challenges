# Challenges
# Arithmetic Challenges
# Remember that floats are numbers with a decimal point whereas integers have no fractional part so in Ruby, 1 and 1.0 are different types of things with slightly different behaviors.

# Add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers and floats.
# Find the remainder of dividing two numbers using the modulo operator (%).
# Divide a number by 0.

# 7/ 0
# puts 7 / 0
#divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)

# Divide 0 by 0.

# 0/0 
# p 0/0
#divided by 0 (ZeroDivisionError)

# Variables Challenges
# Set a variable called my_favorite_number equal to your favorite number

my_favorite_number = 85

# Calculate your favorite number divided by 2

my_favorite_number / 2
p 85 / 2

# Set another variable called someones_favorite equal to 13

someones_favorite = 13

# Change the value of someones_favorite to 7

someones_favorite = 7
p someones_favorite = 7

# Subtract my_favorite_number from someones_favorite

my_favorite_number - someones_favorite
p my_favorite_number - someones_favorite

# Change the value of my favorite number to be 26 times its current value

my_favorite_number * 26
p my_favorite_number * 26

# Strings Challenges
# Create a variable and return it in a sentence string interpolation

num1 = 1
num2 = 4
p "The number #{num1} is less than #{num1 + num2}"

# Create a variable that contains a string and test some of the Ruby string methods
# .upcase
# .reverse
# .include?
# .capitalize
# Arrays Challenges
# Create an array that contains the name of at least five TV shows
# Find the length of the array
# Return the first item in the array
# Return the fourth item in the array
# Permanently reverse the order of the array
# Create a new empty array for your top favorite TV shows
# From the full TV show array, add your top two favorite shows to the empty array
