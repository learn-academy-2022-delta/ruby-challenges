# Lost in the Terminal

# 3 Adventurers find themselves in the black void.


# A prompt appears "Do you click the Red button or the Blue button?"

# Red Button :
# - Adventurers servers crashed and now you returned to the beginning of the Black Hole.

    # Blue Button: 
    # - Prompt: "Magic Web or Dark Web?"

        # Magic Web:
        #  - Prompt: "Do you save an elderly woman or a newborn baby?"

            # Elderly Woman:
            # "The ederly puts you in her Will testiment and she ends up passing away of natural causes a month later after saving her. She left you an estate and also $100 Billion. "

            # Newborn :
            # "The baby grows up and finds you 21 years later and offers to take you to lunch. Little do you know holding a grudge for not saving her grandmother instead of her as a newborn, she poisons your lemonade and with your last moments leans in to tell you that you made the wrong choice."

    # Dark Web:
    #  - FBI storms into your house, kicks your dog, and tackles you to the ground! You are now arrested and thrown in Federal Prison.
